MPEG-G Microbiome Challenge Track 1 - Data Exploration Summary
============================================================

DATASET OVERVIEW:
• Cytokine profiles: 670 samples, 66 cytokines
• Species abundance: 40 samples, 4255 species
• Function abundance: 40 samples, 7973 functions
• Training metadata: 2901 subjects

SAMPLE OVERLAP:
• Cytokine ∩ Species ∩ Functions: 0 samples
• Samples with complete data: 0 samples

DATA CHARACTERISTICS:

DATA QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS:
• High sparsity in microbiome features (many zeros)
• Wide range of abundance values - consider normalization
• Check for batch effects between plates/collection dates
• Consider log transformation for abundance data

FEATURE ENGINEERING RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Apply relative abundance normalization (divide by total reads)
• Log transformation: log(abundance + 1)
• Filter low-abundance features (present in <10% samples)
• Consider aggregation by taxonomic levels (genus, family)
• Principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction
• Check for multicollinearity in cytokine targets
