MPEG-G Microbiome Challenge Track 1 - Comprehensive Data Analysis
======================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
• Challenge involves two separate datasets that cannot be directly linked
• Microbiome data: 40 samples with species/function abundance and clinical metadata
• Cytokine data: 670 samples with 66 cytokine measurements
• Both datasets have been processed and prepared for machine learning

MICROBIOME DATASET:
• Samples: 40
• Features after processing: 9132
• Subjects: 20
• Target variable: Symptom severity (categories)
• Demographics: 40.6±12.3 years

CYTOKINE DATASET:
• Samples: 670
• Cytokines: 66
• Data type: Continuous measurements
• Potential analyses: Network analysis, clustering, prediction

PROCESSING APPLIED:
Microbiome:
  - Relative abundance normalization
  - Log transformation with pseudocount
  - Low prevalence filtering (<10%)
  - Zero variance removal

Cytokines:
  - Missing value imputation (median)
  - Log transformation
  - Standardization (z-score)

ANALYSIS RECOMMENDATIONS:

For Microbiome Data:
• Classification: Predict symptom severity from microbiome composition
• Feature importance: Identify key species/functions
• Temporal analysis: Compare T1 vs T2 timepoints
• Diversity analysis: Alpha/beta diversity metrics

For Cytokine Data:
• Network analysis: Identify cytokine interaction patterns
• Clustering: Group samples by cytokine profiles
• Dimensionality reduction: PCA/UMAP visualization
• Prediction models: Cytokine-to-cytokine relationships

FUTURE DIRECTIONS:
• Seek additional datasets for microbiome-cytokine linkage
• Develop transfer learning approaches
• Meta-analysis with similar published datasets
• Method validation on independent cohorts
