MPEG-G Microbiome Challenge - Sample Mapping Analysis
=======================================================

DATASET STRUCTURE:
• Cytokine data: 670 samples with format 'Sample_XXXXXX'
• Microbiome data: 40 samples with format 'XXXXXXXXXXXX-X'
• Metadata: 20 subjects with paired T1/T2 samples
• Training data: 1262 samples matching cytokine format

KEY FINDINGS:
• NO direct overlap between cytokine and microbiome sample IDs
• Cytokine and training data use same sample ID format
• Microbiome data matches metadata sample naming
• Datasets appear to be from different studies/cohorts

IMPLICATIONS FOR ANALYSIS:
• Cannot create unified microbiome → cytokine prediction model
• Must analyze datasets separately or find alternative connections
• Consider demographic matching if subject info available
• Focus on within-dataset analyses and method development

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
1. Analyze microbiome data separately (40 samples)
2. Analyze cytokine data separately (670 samples)
3. Develop methods on available data
4. Consider transfer learning approaches
5. Look for additional mapping files or documentation
